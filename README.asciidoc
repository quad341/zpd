What is this?
-------------
ZPD is a project to create a media playing daemon on Windows using
link:http://www.zune.net/[Zune] as the player. The reason for wanting to
use Zune is that it allows for using a
link:http://www.zune.net/en-us/products/zunepass/default.htm[Zune Pass] to
play lots of music legally without need to purchase ever track.

The player daemon is supposed to be completely remotely controlled similar
to projects such as link:http://sourceforge.net/projects/musicpd/[MPD].

What is the end goal?
---------------------
It's good to always have a measurement of completion. The actual intent
is to use this as the DJ at my (Jim's) wedding reception. The features I
want available to my guests is:

 * I can control the playback (starting, stopping, skipping)
 * Guests are able to search for music
 * Guests are able to add music to the playlist
 * Guests are able to see what is playing and what will be playing
 * Guests and I are able to do these actions from smart phones
 * Guests and I are able to do these actions at the machine itself
