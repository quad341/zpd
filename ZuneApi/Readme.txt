This is what you need to do to build this project with Visual Studio:

- add your own strong name key file(s) to the projects (or just remove mine).
- add references to the missing DLL files from the Zune Software (inside the Zune installation directory) and the GammaJul.LgLcd library (http://gjlglcd.codeplex.com)
